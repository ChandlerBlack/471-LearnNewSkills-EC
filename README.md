  Description: 
    This project was a warmup for some of the other python projects that I am going to be doing for this assignment because I want to get a little more comfortable with python. Since I am a cybersecurity inclined person, I thought it would be fun to make a simple keylogger. I followed the tutorial from the link that I have provided. I expanded on and made improvements on the code that the lesson gave such as (what i feel to be) better formatting for the output log, and some bash and batch scripts that if I tweaked a bit more will allow the keylogger to be run on a host computer from a usb. Overall, this was a fun quick project it only took me like 30ish minutes to do it. Not sure how I need to list the time spent for this project but I am going to play it safe and go by the length of the course videos.
